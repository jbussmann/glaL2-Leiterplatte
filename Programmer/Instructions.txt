Flashing BluePill over UART:
----------------------------

- Install empty sketch on Arduino Nano
- Connect Arduino TX -> PA9 (TX)
- Connect Arduino RX -> PA10 (RX)
- Connect power and ground
- Set BOOT0 to 1 (High) and BOOT1 to 0 (Low)
- Reset BluePill (Bootloader)
- Open Flash Loader Demonstrator
- Set Baud Rate to highest, Timeout to lowest
- Connect to MCU and flash firmware
- Reset after failed attempt

Troubleshooting:
- Check BluePill for sufficient voltage and good ground connection
- On breadboards it can take many attempts due to bad contacts
- Set Flash Loader to low Baud Rate to see RX-LED briefly light up
- Try connecting Arduino RST to ground


Converting BluePill to ST-Link V2:
----------------------------------

- Prepare firmware flash over UART
- Flash ST-Link V2 firmware (STLinkV2.J16.S4.bin) to BluePill
- Disonnect and reset BluePill
- Connect BluePill over USB
- Open ST-Link firmware update in ST-Link Utility
- BluePill shows up as STM32+STM8 Debugger, V2.J16.S4
- Confirm Update to e.g. V2.J34.S7
- BluePill now shows up as STM32+STM8 Debugger, V2.J34.S7
- For use as ST-Link a resistor is needed between PB12 and PB14 


Flashing ST-Link V2.1 on STM32F103CB MCU:
-----------------------------------------

- This procedure only works with ST-Link Utility v4.3
- Prepare firmware flash over UART or SWD
- Flash ST-Link V2.1 bootloader (Bootloader-2-1-Protected.bin)
- Connect Device over USB
- Open ST-Link firmware update in ST-Link Utility
- Confirm Update to e.g. STM32+MSD+VCP
- Update for annoyiign warnings


Flashing ST-Link V2.1 on STM32F103C8 MCU:
-----------------------------------------

- Same as above but flash limited to 64K
- Therefore Product Option STM32+MSD+VCP is not available


Converting BluePill to ST-Link V2:
----------------------------------

- Same as above but requires manual enumeration
